### EXERCISE 
Matrix Multiplication (with Multi-threading)

### INPUT
A text file named `matrix.in` which contains the following:
* the no. of matrix operations to perform
* dimension of the `Matrix A`
* the elements of `Matrix A`
* dimension of `Matrix B`
* the elements of `Matrix B`

### SPECIFICATIONS
* For a single matrix operation, a total of `m x n` threads will be created corresponding to the dimension of the resulting matrix
* For each thread, the row of `Matrix A` and the column of `Matrix B` shall be passed as arguments

### OUTPUT
* Print `Matrix A`
* Print `Matrix B`
* Print the resulting matrix derived from `A x B`
